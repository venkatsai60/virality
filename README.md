Analyzing Social Media Content to Identify Factors Driving Viral Video Propagation
Project Overview
This project aims to understand the factors contributing to viral video propagation on social media platforms. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze video metrics like views, likes, comments, and dislikes to predict the likelihood of a video going viral. The system includes an interactive web interface where users can input YouTube video URLs to receive insights and actionable recommendations.
